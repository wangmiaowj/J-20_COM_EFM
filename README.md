This EFM project is based on the EFM project of VSN_AND_FRIENDS_COM_F35_FC3 (https://github.com/mrjayy/VSN_AND_FRIENDS_COM_F35_FC3). The data is not much different from the original EFM project engineering. I am a code engineer and do not have much time to learn professional aviation knowledge and aerodynamics knowledge. Therefore, the code can only be extended with ready-made EFM project projects.
The only data that have been changed is the maximum takeoff weight, fuel weight, wingspan and wing area. Code Logic adds a second engine, vectoring nozzles, ground taxi reverse, APU, canard speed brakes, drag chute and wheel chocks. Using part of the A-4E technology, radio communications, ILS, power systems and LUA_VM were implemented. Removed VTOL related code
If there is any infringement of copyrights related to VSN-F35 and A-4E, I will delete the repository and withdraw the download link for DCS:J-20A
